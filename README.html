<p>Profoundly dumb placeholder text placed into various CSS Grid layouts. </p>
<h1 id="what-this-is">What This Is</h1>
<p>This is a randomized quote website to serve up the bonkers stuff my co-worker says. The website uses React and a smidge of other scripts to load the content and layouts.</p>

<ul>
<li>Scripting: Reach &amp; vanilla JavaScript</li>
<li>CSS: Mostly custom, uses Bourbon Neat for the responsive structure, also Normalize for general misc.</li>
<li>Quotes: 100% crazy talk from the guy at work. Seriously can&#39;t make this stuff up.</li>
<li>Build process: I&#39;m using PrePros for the build process. Small site, so no need to Gulp this.</li>
</ul>
